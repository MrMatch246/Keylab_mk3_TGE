# Arturia Keylab MK3 TGE
------------------------------------

Modified the Scripts for the Arturia KeyLab Mk3 to add all the easy fixes and the cool features that arturia just overlooked!
As i am more of an Arrangement Person, please let me know if there is anything in the session direction that would be useful!
Or anything! I am open to suggestions and will try to implement them as best as i can!
Watch this repo to get notifications about updates!


## IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES:
- Please let me know! I will try to fix them as soon as possible!
- If you can, please provide the log file that is generated by Ableton Live:
    - Windows:  \Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Ableton\Live x.x.x\Preferences\Log.txt
    - Mac:  /Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/Ableton/Live x.x.x/Log.txt
- If you DO have Python3 installed and want to use the features you have to set the "I_HAVE_PYTHON_3" flag in the settings.py to True !!!
    - You can just use a text editor to open the file and change the value to "False" and save it.
    - On Windows you can just install it from the Microsoft Store (3.11> is recommended)

-IMPORTANT: Rename the "KeyLab_mk3_TGE-main" folder to "KeyLab_mk3_TGE" (if you see it, do it)



## Current Features (You can choose which to use):


### KNOBS AND FADERS
- Fader 9 Controls #Todo
- Knob 9 Controls #Todo

### REWIND/FASTFORWARD
- You can set Rewind and FastForward Speed in the settings.py file (currently set to 4 instead of 1)

### PLAY BUTTON
- Play Button can work as Play/Pause Button
    - normal press = play/pause inplace
    - long press = play from marker (mouse click)


### GENERAL
- Holding the Loop Button loops the current selection (Ctrl + L) (needs python3)
- SHIFT + LOOP can now force a filesystem update #TODO IMPLEMENT
    - When having an external drive or google drive folder in Places and there are external changes to it, the filesystem might not update automatically resulting in you having to manually create a textfile there and deleting it again
    - This will be done in python now, but you need to specify the correct path in the settings.py file
    - PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS FEATURE, I WILL HELP YOU SET IT UP (its easy but not straightforward)




### PADS
