# IF you scroll through tracks but the arranger is focused, the window wont scroll
# The workaround is to focus another view.
# If no other view is available, you can have any of the above views shown.
# The default value is None which means nothing will happen.
# Available views are: 'Browser', 'Detail/DeviceChain', 'Detail/Clip' , 'Detail'
